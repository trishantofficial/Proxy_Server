<h3>A basic proxy server in Python</h3>

1.) Accepts connection from client.<br>
2.) Reads, decodes and breaks down the packet into a fixed structure, that was requested by the client.<br>
3.) Prints the packet structure and forwards the request to the host.<br>
4.) Finally, returns the response from the host to the client.<br>

This can be modified to host on a remote location and be can be customized to accept or reject requests or any other other rule.
